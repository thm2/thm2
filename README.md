- 👋 Hi, I’m Theo.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Data Science and Optimization.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a personal project involving web-scrapping, NLP, data analysis and machine learning in Python. This project aims to analyze possible discrepancies between critic and user scores on sites such as Metacritic, and find the causes of such a discrepancy in critic and user scores, e.g., review "bombings" etc.
